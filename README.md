# Introduction
Dwayne The Bot Chatson is an open domain chatbot with whom you can have random conversations via Telegram. It is trained on dialogs from movies thus Dwayne can be poetic or temperamental at times.

# Data
We concatenated two open-source datasets for training of our NLP model. The [rDany Chat datset] (https://www.kaggle.com/eibriel/rdany-conversations) mimics conversations of a human with his virtual companion. In addition the [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus] (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) consists of conversational exchanges from movie scripts.
